Many Omni apps are available as **Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)** — lightweight, installable apps that run directly from your browser. No app store required.

<Callout type="info">
  PWAs update automatically, work offline, and feel just like native apps on your device.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| No install option appears | Ensure you're using a supported browser (Safari on iOS, Chrome on Android/desktop) |
| App not updating | Close and reopen the app — PWAs update automatically in the background |
| App disappeared after update | Re-install from the browser using the steps above |
| Notifications not working | Check your device notification settings and ensure the app has permission |
