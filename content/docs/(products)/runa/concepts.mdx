# Core Concepts

Runa organizes your work into a simple hierarchy that scales from personal projects to team collaboration.

## Workspaces

A **Workspace** is your team's home base. It's where you organize all your projects and collaborate with others.

- Invite team members to collaborate
- Set up default columns that apply to new projects
- Manage roles and permissions (Owner, Admin, Member)

Think of a workspace as your company, department, or team: whatever grouping makes sense for the people working together.

## Projects

A **Project** is a collection of related work. Each project lives inside a workspace and has its own board of tasks.

- Track a product launch, a client engagement, or a personal goal
- Customize columns to match your workflow
- Use labels to categorize tasks within the project

## Columns

**Columns** represent the stages of your workflow. Tasks move through columns as work progresses.

Common setups include:
- **To Do** → **In Progress** → **Done**
- **Backlog** → **Ready** → **In Progress** → **Review** → **Complete**

You can customize columns with names and emojis to match how your team works.

## Tasks

A **Task** is a single piece of work, the core unit in Runa. Everything else exists to help you organize and track tasks.

Each task can have:
- A title and description
- Priority level (low, medium, high)
- Due date
- Assignees (who's responsible)
- Labels (for categorization)
- Comments (for discussion)

### Cards

In board view, tasks appear as **Cards**: draggable rectangles that show key details at a glance. Drag cards between columns as work progresses, or reorder them within a column to set priority.

In list view, the same tasks appear as rows instead of cards.

## How It All Fits Together

```
Workspace (your team)
└── Project (a body of work)
    └── Column (a workflow stage)
        └── Task (a piece of work)
```

## View Modes

Runa offers different ways to view your tasks:

| View | Best for |
|------|----------|
| **Board** | Visual workflow, drag-and-drop organization |
| **List** | Quick scanning, keyboard-heavy workflows |

Both views show the same tasks, just organized differently.
