---

# Android

Omni Terminal for Android provides a full terminal experience on mobile. It supports local shells via an Arch Linux environment (powered by PRoot), remote WebSocket connections over TLS, multi-session tabs, and persistent settings.

## Requirements

- Android 8.0+ (API level 26)
- arm64 (aarch64) device

## Features

### Local Shell

Omni Terminal ships with a lightweight busybox-based shell environment that installs automatically on first launch. This provides core Unix utilities (`ls`, `cat`, `grep`, `find`, `sed`, `tar`, etc.) without any additional downloads.

### Arch Linux via PRoot

For a full Linux environment, Omni Terminal can install Arch Linux ARM (~170 MB download) and run it via [PRoot](https://proot-me.github.io/). This gives you access to `pacman` and the entire Arch Linux package ecosystem.

Once installed, the Arch environment provides:

- **Full package manager**: `pacman -S <package>` to install anything from the Arch repos
- **Development tools**: `gcc`, `rust`, `python`, `node`, `git`, `ssh`, and more
- **Networking**: Outbound TCP/UDP works natively through Android's network stack
- **Faked root**: PRoot's `-0` flag simulates root — `sudo` is unnecessary
- **Filesystem access**: `/sdcard` is bound into the PRoot environment for access to local files

```bash
# inside the Arch environment
pacman -S openssh git python
ssh user@example.com
```

### Remote Connections

Connect to a remote [Omni Terminal web server](/armory/omni-terminal/web) over secure WebSocket (WSS/TLS). Enter the server URL on the home screen and tap **Connect**.

URL formats accepted:

- `wss://hostname:port/ws`
- `https://hostname:port` (auto-converted to `wss://`)
- `ws://hostname:port` (unencrypted, local network only)

### Multi-Session Tabs

Create multiple terminal sessions within a single connection. The tab bar at the top shows all active sessions — tap **+** to add a new one, long-press a tab to close it.

### Settings

Access settings via the gear icon in the toolbar.

| Setting | Options | Default |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Theme | Dark, Solarized Dark, Light | Dark |
| Font size | Adjustable via pinch gesture or settings | 18 |

Settings persist across app restarts.

### Input

**Toolbar buttons** provide quick access to modifier keys and special characters:

| Button | Function |
|--------|----------|
| CTRL | Toggle Ctrl modifier |
| ALT | Toggle Alt modifier |
| ESC | Send Escape |
| TAB | Send Tab |
| Arrows | Send arrow key sequences |
| `/` `-` `\|` `~` | Common shell characters |

**Gestures:**

| Gesture | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Tap | Focus terminal, show keyboard |
| Pinch | Zoom font size |
| Long-press | Begin text selection |
| Drag (after long-press) | Extend selection (auto-copies on release) |
| Scroll | Scroll through terminal history |

**Hardware keyboard** support includes function keys, arrow keys, Ctrl+letter, and Alt+key combinations.

### Storage Access

Tap **Setup Storage** on the home screen to create symlinks from the terminal environment to common Android directories:

| Symlink | Target |
|---------|--------|
| `~/storage/shared` | `/sdcard` |
| `~/storage/downloads` | `/sdcard/Download` |
| `~/storage/dcim` | `/sdcard/DCIM` |
| `~/storage/pictures` | `/sdcard/Pictures` |
| `~/storage/music` | `/sdcard/Music` |
| `~/storage/movies` | `/sdcard/Movies` |

### Background Service

When the app is backgrounded, a foreground service keeps terminal sessions alive. A persistent notification shows the number of active sessions.

## Building

### Prerequisites

- Android NDK (`ANDROID_NDK_HOME` set)
- Rust with the `aarch64-linux-android` target
- `cargo-ndk`

### Build and Install

```bash
# build bootstrap archive (busybox + proot, one-time)
just android-bootstrap

# build native library + APK (debug)
just android-build

# build, install, and launch on connected device
just android-deploy

# watch for changes and auto-deploy
just android-watch
```

### Release Build

```bash
just android-release
```

## Permissions

| Permission | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `INTERNET` | Remote WebSocket connections |
| `MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` | Access to `/sdcard` for storage symlinks |
| `FOREGROUND_SERVICE` | Keep sessions alive when backgrounded |
| `WAKE_LOCK` | Prevent device sleep during active sessions |

## Limitations

- **PRoot overhead**: Syscall translation via ptrace adds ~5-15% overhead to syscall-heavy workloads (e.g. compiling large projects). Interactive use is unaffected
- **No true root**: PRoot fakes root via UID/GID translation. Operations requiring real kernel privileges (e.g. mounting filesystems, loading kernel modules) are not supported
- **arm64 only**: x86/x86_64 Android devices are not currently supported
