# Skills

Skills are reusable instruction sets that teach the agent specialized behaviors. They're markdown files with YAML frontmatter that the agent can load on demand.

## Overview

Skills allow you to:

- Define specialized workflows (TDD, debugging, code review)
- Share best practices across projects
- Create custom agent behaviors without modifying code

## Skill File Format

Skills are defined in `SKILL.md` files:

```markdown
---
name: test-driven-development
description: Use when implementing features - write tests first
---

# Test-Driven Development

## Process

1. Write a failing test for the feature
2. Run the test to confirm it fails
3. Write minimal code to make the test pass
4. Run the test to confirm it passes
5. Refactor if needed

## Guidelines

- Keep tests focused and isolated
- Test behavior, not implementation
- Use descriptive test names
```

### Frontmatter Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | Yes | Unique skill identifier |
| `description` | Yes | When to use this skill |

## Skill Discovery

Omni CLI discovers skills from these locations (in order):

### Project-Local

```
your-project/
├── .omni/skill/
│   └── my-skill/
│       └── SKILL.md
└── .claude/skills/
    └── shared-skill/
        └── SKILL.md
```

### Global

```
~/.config/omni/skill/
└── global-skill/
    └── SKILL.md

~/.claude/skills/
└── claude-skill/
    └── SKILL.md
```

Project-local skills take precedence over global skills with the same name.

## Using Skills

### Automatic Loading

The agent automatically considers skills based on task context. If you ask to "implement a feature using TDD", a skill with that description will be loaded.

### Manual Loading

Use the `skill` tool to explicitly load a skill:

```
Load the code-review skill for this task
```

### Listing Skills

```bash
omni skill list
```

## Built-in Skills

Omni CLI includes several built-in skills:

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `test-driven-development` | Write tests before implementation |
| `systematic-debugging` | Methodical bug investigation |
| `code-review` | Review code for quality and issues |
| `documentation` | Write clear documentation |

## Creating Custom Skills

### Basic Skill

Create `.omni/skill/my-workflow/SKILL.md`:

```markdown
---
name: my-workflow
description: Use for my specific workflow
---

# My Custom Workflow

Instructions for the agent...
```

### Skill with Checklist

Skills can include checklists that the agent tracks:

```markdown
---
name: release-checklist
description: Use when preparing a release
---

# Release Checklist

## Pre-Release

- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Version bumped
- [ ] Changelog updated
- [ ] Documentation current

## Release

- [ ] Create release branch
- [ ] Build artifacts
- [ ] Tag release
- [ ] Publish
```

### Skill with Examples

Include examples to guide the agent:

```markdown
---
name: api-design
description: Use when designing REST APIs
---

# API Design Guidelines

## Endpoint Naming

Use plural nouns:

Good:
- `GET /users`
- `POST /users`
- `GET /users/{id}`

Bad:
- `GET /user`
- `POST /createUser`
```

## Compatibility

Omni CLI supports skill directories from:

- `.omni/skill/` (native)
- `.claude/skills/` (Claude Code compatibility)

This allows sharing skills across different AI coding tools.
