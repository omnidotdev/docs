**Omni Synapse** is a unified AI inference gateway that sits between user-facing applications (CLI, Beacon) and LLM providers. It handles authentication, billing, and intelligent routing so users don't need to manage API keys.

## How It Works

```
User (CLI/Beacon) → Synapse Gateway → Best Provider/Model → Response
                         │
                    Auth (Gatekeeper JWT)
                    Billing (Aether entitlements)
                    Routing (smart model selection)
```

Synapse authenticates users via their Omni account, checks billing entitlements, and routes requests to the optimal provider based on the chosen routing strategy.

## Supported Providers

| Provider | Models | Capabilities |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Anthropic | Claude family | Chat, vision |
| OpenAI | GPT family, Whisper, TTS | Chat, STT, TTS, embeddings, image generation |
| Google | Gemini family | Chat, vision |
| Groq | Llama, Mixtral | Chat (fast inference) |
| Mistral | Mistral family | Chat |
| AWS Bedrock | Multi-provider | Chat |
| ElevenLabs | | Text-to-speech |
| Deepgram | | Speech-to-text |

## Routing Strategies

Synapse doesn't just proxy requests. It intelligently routes them:

| Strategy | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Threshold** | Route by query complexity (simple → cheap model, complex → powerful model) |
| **Cost** | Maximize quality within a budget constraint |
| **Cascade** | Try cheap model first, escalate if confidence is low |
| **Score-optimized** | Multi-objective scoring across quality, speed, and cost |

## Access Tiers

| Tier | How it works |
|------|-------------|
| **Free** | Limited credits on signup, no payment required |
| **BYOK** | User provides their own provider API keys, Synapse provides routing only |
| **Pro** | Managed keys with smart routing, monthly subscription via Aether |
| **Team** | Shared organization billing with usage visibility |

## Key Crates

| Crate | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `synapse-llm` | Multi-backend LLM support |
| `synapse-routing` | Smart routing engine |
| `synapse-auth` | JWT validation via Gatekeeper |
| `synapse-billing` | Usage metering via Aether |
| `synapse-mcp` | Model Context Protocol support |
| `synapse-client` | Client SDK (integrates with agent-core) |
| `synapse-embeddings` | Embedding model support |
| `synapse-imagegen` | Image generation providers |
| `stt` / `tts` | Speech provider support |

## Integration with Omni

Synapse is deeply integrated with the Omni platform:

- **Authentication**: Users authenticate with their Omni account (Gatekeeper JWT)
- **Billing**: Usage metered through Aether, subscriptions via Stripe
- **CLI**: `synapse-client` crate integrates directly with agent-core
- **Beacon**: All voice (STT/TTS) and chat traffic routes through Synapse

## Getting Started

1. **Sign up** at [synapse.omni.dev](https://synapse.omni.dev) with your Omni account
2. **Generate an API key** from the [dashboard](https://synapse.omni.dev/dashboard/keys)
3. **Send a request** using the OpenAI-compatible endpoint:

```bash
curl https://synapse.omni.dev/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer synapse_YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]}'
```

For detailed setup instructions, see the [Getting Started guide](/grid/synapse/getting-started).
