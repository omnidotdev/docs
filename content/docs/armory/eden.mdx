## Key Features

- **Dependency Verification**: Check for required binaries and environment variables
- **Configuration-as-Code**: Define preflight requirements in a simple config: TOML, YAML, JSON(C) supported
- **CI Integration**: Run as part of CI pipelines to ensure environment consistency
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Linux and macOS development environments
- **Rust Performance**: Fast checks with minimal system overhead

## How It Works

Eden runs a series of checks defined in your Eden configuration file to verify that your development environment has everything needed to work on a specific project. This includes checking for:

- Required binaries (Docker, Tilt, node, etc.)
- Environment variables

## Configuration

Eden uses a simple configuration file to define what should be checked, e.g. this TOML:

```toml
# eden.toml

[checks]
# required binaries (must be in PATH)
binaries = [
    "docker",
    "tilt",
    "node",
]

# required environment variables
environment = [
    "DATABASE_URL",
    "API_KEY",
]
```

Eden also supports `eden.yaml`, `eden.json`, and `eden.jsonc` configuration formats.

## Example Usage

```bash
# run all preflight checks in the current directory
$ eden check

🌱 Binary: docker - v20.10.8 (/usr/bin/docker)
🌱 Binary: tilt - v0.30.12 (/usr/bin/tilt)
🥀 Binary: node - not found in PATH
🌱 Env: DATABASE_URL - set
🥀 Env: API_KEY - not set

🌱 3 sprouted, 🥀 2 need water
```

## Integration with Development Workflows

Eden can be integrated into various development workflows:

- **New Developer Onboarding**: Have new team members run Eden as their first step
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Verify environments before running tests
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Ensure environment consistency before commits
- **Project Bootstrap**: Include in project setup scripts

## Getting Started

1. Install Eden:

   ```bash
   # install via cargo
   cargo install eden-cli

   # or download binaries from GitHub releases
   # https://github.com/omnidotdev/eden-cli/releases
   ```

2. Create an `eden.toml` file in your project root (manually or with `eden init`):

   ```toml
   [checks]
   binaries = ["docker", "tilt"]
   environment = ["DATABASE_URL"]
   ```

3. Run the preflight check:

   ```bash
   eden check
   ```

## Roadmap

Eden is in active development. Planned features include:

- **Version Constraints**: Validate specific versions (`node >= 18.0.0`)
- **Environment Validation**: Check environment variable formats (`API_KEY = "non-empty"`)
- **Network Checks**: Verify connectivity to required services
- **Disk Space Checks**: Ensure minimum disk space
- **Custom Scripts**: Run project-specific validation scripts
- **Auto-Fix**: Interactive guided resolution for missing dependencies
- **JSON Output**: Machine-readable output for CI pipelines (`--json`)
- **Custom Configuration**: Allow custom configuration files and directories
- **Multi-Project Support**: Validate multiple projects simultaneously

See the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/omnidotdev/eden-cli) for progress.
