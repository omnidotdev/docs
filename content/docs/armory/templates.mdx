Omni curates a handful of [template repositories](https://github.com/orgs/omnidotdev/repositories?q=template%3Atrue+archived%3Afalse) you can use to get started with your projects.

These are opinionated templates that contain Omni's tech stack and best practices. We use them for our own projects, and they serve as **canonical references**.

  For code style conventions and patterns, see [👑 Golden](/community/contributing/golden). Templates provide config files and scaffolding; Golden documents how to write code.
