In one word: **Freedom.**

Omni is committed to building open-source software, which includes apps, websites, APIs, developer tools, and other software that provides complete access to its source code. This allows users to inspect, modify, and redistribute it freely, including for free commercial usage. This inherent freedom promotes transparency, innovation, and community-driven development without restrictive licensing barriers.

Creating open-source software aligns with Omni’s core values, which prioritize freedom and openness. By developing with a focus on transparency, privacy, and security, Omni ensures its software is trustworthy and accessible. Moreover, by making the source code openly available, Omni invites the global community to engage in the highest level of collaboration, fostering innovation and collective improvement through shared contributions and scrutiny.
