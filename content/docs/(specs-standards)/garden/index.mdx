Garden graphs are composed of:

- **Sprouts**: Individual entities within gardens representing products, services, tools, or any other element in your ecosystem
- **Gardens**: Collections of sprouts or other gardens (**subgardens**). Gardens may also be nested within other gardens (**supergardens**)

## Demo

Below, **Omni Ecosystem** is a _supergarden_ of the **Omni Products** and **Omni Dev Tools** gardens, which are _subgardens_ in this case.

**Omni Docs** is a _sprout_ of the Omni Ecosystem garden. Backfeed is a sprout of the Omni Products garden, while Sigil is a sprout of the Omni Dev Tools garden.

<div className="w-full h-[600px] mt-4">
  {/* TODO grab schema from API/remote source */}
  <Garden schema={schema} expandSubgardens showMinimap={false} />
</div>

## Features

- **Interactive Visualization**: Navigate through your ecosystem with an intuitive, interactive graph interface via the <br /> `<Garden />` component shipped with `@omnidotdev/garden`
- **Hierarchical Navigation**: Explore complex relationships with support for nested gardens (subgardens/supergardens)
- **Customizable Nodes**: Personalize node appearance with custom themes, colors, and styling
- **Smart Layout**: Automatic layout calculation ensures optimal presentation of your garden
- **Edge Customization**: Choose from various edge types and animations to visualize connections
- **Responsive Design**: Works across different screen sizes and devices
- **React Integration**: Easily integrate with React applications as a standalone component
- **Rich Node Content**: Support for images, descriptions, call-to-action buttons, and external links
- **Garden Switching**: Navigate between multiple gardens within the same visualization
- **Minimap & Controls**: Optional navigation aids for larger garden structures

## Getting Started

To integrate Garden in your React application, first `bun add @omnidotdev/garden`, then:

```tsx
import { Garden } from "@omnidotdev/garden";

import type { GardenSchema } from "@omnidotdev/garden";

// import required Garden styles
import "@omnidotdev/garden/styles.css";

const schema: GardenSchema = {
  name: "Ecosystem",
  // ...
};

/**
 * Render the Garden component with the provided ecosystem schema.
 *
 * `schema` is validated against the Garden specification at runtime.
 * If the schema is invalid, an error will be thrown.
 */
const App = () => <Garden schema={schema} />;
```
