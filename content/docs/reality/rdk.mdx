**Omni Reality Development Kit (RDK)** is a React-first framework for building web-based XR experiences, from AR to VR, orchestrated through one unified API powered by Three.js and react-three-fiber.

RDK aims to be a one-stop platform for all web-based spatial and immersive computing use cases.

More docs coming soon, hang tight anon ᯅ
