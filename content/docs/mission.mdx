At Omni, we operate on a **twofold mission** that guides everything we build.

## 1. Democratize Business Technology

We break down the walls of closed, costly, and bloated corporate systems by building open, accessible, and affordable tools that restore user control.

For decades, powerful software has been locked behind expensive licenses, proprietary formats, and vendor lock-in. We believe everyone deserves access to enterprise-grade tools without the enterprise price tag or the strings attached. This aligns with the original, freedom-oriented vision of the world wide web.

## 2. Empower the Creator Economy

We're building the open foundation of the new economy—interconnected tools that help creators, developers, and teams automate work and scale freely.

The future belongs to independent creators, small teams, and communities who can move fast and own their work. Our tools are designed to amplify human creativity.

## Permanent Freedom

Our overarching vision is to provide the **digital fabric for creators and teams**—enabling transformation from initial concept to fully automated, scalable business.

This means:

- **No vendor lock-in.** Your data is yours. Export it, self-host it, or migrate whenever you want.
- **Open-source foundations.** Inspect the code, contribute improvements, or fork it entirely.
- **Sustainable independence.** Build on a foundation that won't disappear when a company pivots or gets acquired.

We call this **permanent freedom**—the ability to grow your ambitions without artificial limits.
