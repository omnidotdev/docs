title: Ethos
---

These are the values that shape how we build, operate, and grow as a company.

## Open by Default

We believe openness creates better software and stronger communities.

- **Open-source, self-hostable solutions.** Our core tools are open-source. You can inspect the code, contribute improvements, and self-host when you need full control.
- **No vendor lock-in.** We design for portability. Your data and workflows are never trapped.
- **Community-driven development.** Users influence our roadmap (see [Backfeed](/core/backfeed)). We build what matters to the people who use our tools.

## Transparent Operations

Trust is built through transparency.

- **Transparent pricing.** No hidden fees, no surprise charges, no "contact sales" barriers.
- **Transparent processes.** Our roadmap, decisions, and trade-offs are discussed openly.
- **Transparent ethics.** We're clear about what we will and won't do with your data.

## Ownership by Design

Creators should own their work—permanently.

- **Your data is yours.** Export everything, anytime, in standard formats.
- **Permanent control.** We don't hold your work hostage. If you leave, you take everything with you.
- **Self-hosting options.** For those who need it, full sovereignty over their infrastructure.

## Human + Machine

We combine human creativity with intelligent automation.

- **Human creativity first.** Our tools amplify what humans do best.
- **AI-augmented development.** We embrace AI as a collaborator, using it to accelerate and enhance our work.
- **Expert knowledge encoded.** Our software captures best practices so teams can move faster without reinventing the wheel.
