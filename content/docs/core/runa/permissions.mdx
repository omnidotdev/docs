Runa uses role-based access control (RBAC) within workspaces. Each workspace member has one of three roles:

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Owner** | Full control over the workspace. Cannot be modified or removed by others. |
| **Admin** | Can manage projects, members, and settings. Cannot delete the workspace. |
| **Member** | Can create and manage their own tasks. Limited administrative access. |

### Permission Matrix
