description: Create and run your first workflow

Get up and running with Vortex in a few minutes. Choose between Docker Compose for local development or Helm for Kubernetes deployments.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and Docker Compose v2
- A copy of the [vortex-stack](https://github.com/omnidotdev/vortex) repository

## 1. Start the stack

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/omnidotdev/vortex vortex-stack
cd vortex-stack

# Copy the environment template and fill in secrets
cp .env.local.template .env.local

# Start all services
docker compose up
```

This starts PostgreSQL, Valkey (cache), Iggy (event streaming), and the three Vortex services (API, app, worker). Once healthy, the dashboard is available at `http://localhost:3000` and the API at `http://localhost:4000`.

See [Self-Hosting](/grid/vortex/self-hosting) for Kubernetes and production deployment options.

## 2. Create a workflow

Vortex supports three authoring modes. Every format round-trips to the others.

### Visual editor

Open the dashboard at `http://localhost:3000`, navigate to **Workflows**, and click **New Workflow**. Drag steps from the sidebar, connect them with edges, and configure each step inline.

### JSON DSL

Paste or import a JSON definition into the editor's import dialog:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "steps": [
    {
      "id": "trigger_1",
      "type": "trigger",
      "name": "Webhook",
      "trigger": { "type": "webhook" }
    },
    {
      "id": "notify",
      "type": "action",
      "name": "Send Slack message",
      "integration": "slack",
      "operation": "sendMessage",
      "inputs": {
        "channel": "#alerts",
        "text": "New event: {{triggerData.body.event}}"
      }
    }
  ],
  "edges": [
    { "id": "e-trigger-notify", "source": "trigger_1", "target": "notify" }
  ]
}
```

### TypeScript SDK

Install the SDK and define workflows programmatically:

```bash
bun add @omnidotdev/vortex-sdk
```

```typescript
import { workflow, trigger, action } from "@omnidotdev/vortex-sdk";

const definition = workflow("order-processor")
  .trigger(trigger.webhook({ path: "/orders" }))
  .step("validate", action("validator", "check", {
    inputs: { id: "$.orderId" },
  }))
  .step("charge", action("stripe", "charge", {
    inputs: { amount: "$.total" },
  }))
  .build();
```

## 3. Trigger a run

### Webhook

Every workflow with a webhook trigger gets a unique URL:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/webhooks/workflow/<workflowId>/<secret> \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"event": "order.created", "orderId": "ord_123"}'
```

### Cron

Set a cron expression on the trigger and Vortex fires the workflow automatically. The scheduler uses distributed locking for multi-instance safety.

### Event

Subscribe to events from any Omni service. The event router matches incoming events by type pattern, optional conditions, and optional transforms.

### Manual

Trigger a run from the UI or via API:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/v1/workflows/<workflowId>/trigger \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <api-key>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"data": {"userId": "u_123"}}'
```

## 4. Monitor execution

The dashboard shows real-time workflow run status, step-by-step execution traces, and variable state. Runs also emit lifecycle events (`vortex.workflow.started`, `vortex.workflow.completed`, `vortex.workflow.failed`) that can trigger other workflows.
