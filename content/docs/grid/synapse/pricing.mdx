description: Operating modes, managed keys, and Omni Credits
---

Synapse supports multiple operating modes depending on how you want to manage API keys and billing.

## Operating Modes

### BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)

Configure your own API keys for each provider. Synapse routes requests using your keys with no markup or fees.

```toml
[llm.providers.anthropic]
type = "anthropic"
api_key = "{{ env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}"
```

- **Cost**: You pay the provider directly at their standard rates
- **Setup**: Requires creating accounts and API keys with each provider
- **Best for**: Teams that already have provider accounts or want maximum cost control

### Managed

Omni provides API keys and handles billing. You pay Omni a single invoice with a small margin on top of provider costs.

```toml
[llm.providers.anthropic]
type = "anthropic"
managed = true
```

- **Cost**: Provider rates + Omni margin
- **Setup**: Connect your Omni account, no provider accounts needed
- **Best for**: Teams that want zero-config provider access

<Callout type="info">
  Managed mode requires an Omni account. Connect at **Settings -> Cloud -> Connect Omni Account** in Beacon, or configure the Omni API key in your Synapse config.
</Callout>

### Hybrid

Mix BYOK and managed providers. Use your own key for some providers and let Omni manage others:

```toml
# BYOK -- use your own key
[llm.providers.anthropic]
type = "anthropic"
api_key = "{{ env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}"

# Managed -- Omni provides the key
[llm.providers.openai]
type = "openai"
managed = true
```

This is useful when you have a discount or enterprise agreement with one provider but want easy access to others.

## Managed Margins

Managed mode adds a configurable margin on top of provider costs. The default margin is set by Omni and varies by plan tier. Enterprise customers can negotiate custom margins.

| Tier | Margin | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Free | 20% | Limited monthly usage |
| Pro | 10% | Higher limits, priority routing |
| Enterprise | Custom | Volume discounts, SLA |

## Omni Credits

Omni Credits are a prepaid credit system for managed providers:

1. Purchase credits through the Omni dashboard or API
2. Credits are consumed as you make API requests through managed providers
3. Usage is tracked per-request with full cost transparency
4. Credits never expire

### Credit Consumption

Each request consumes credits based on the provider's per-token or per-request pricing, plus the managed margin. You can view real-time credit usage in the Omni dashboard.

### Low Balance Alerts

Configure alerts to notify you when credits are running low:

- Email notifications at configurable thresholds
- Webhook notifications for programmatic monitoring
- Auto-recharge for uninterrupted service
