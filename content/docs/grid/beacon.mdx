**Omni Beacon** is an always-on AI assistant gateway designed for everyday users. Think of it as your personal AI that lives on your machine, listens for your voice, and connects to all your messaging platforms.

## Architecture

Beacon consists of three services:

| Service | Language | Purpose |
|---------|----------|---------|
| `beacon-gateway` | Rust | Core daemon: wake word detection, STT/TTS, channel routing, tool execution |
| `beacon-api` | TypeScript (Elysia) | GraphQL API for session management and configuration |
| `beacon-app` | React + Tauri | Cross-platform desktop and web app |

All AI intelligence is powered by [agent-core](/armory/omni-cli), the shared Rust library also used by the Omni CLI.

## Key Features

- **Voice interface**: Wake word detection, speech-to-text, and text-to-speech via Synapse
- **Multi-channel**: Chat across Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Telegram, Teams, Google Chat, Signal, Matrix, and iMessage
- **Browser automation**: Navigate, screenshot, interact with web pages via headless browser (chromiumoxide/CDP)
- **Task scheduling**: Create and manage scheduled tasks via Vortex integration
- **Persona system**: Customizable AI personalities following the [persona.json spec](https://persona.omni.dev)
- **Local-first**: Runs on your machine, your data stays with you
- **Cross-platform app**: Works in browser and as a native Tauri desktop app

## Voice Pipeline

| Stage | Implementation |
|-------|---------------|
| Wake word | Energy-based local detection (RMS thresholding) |
| Audio capture | `cpal` library, 16kHz mono |
| Speech-to-text | Via Synapse (OpenAI Whisper or Deepgram) |
| Text-to-speech | Via Synapse (OpenAI TTS or ElevenLabs) |
| Playback | `cpal` + `minimp3`, 24kHz |

## Messaging Channels

All 9 channels implement a unified `Channel` trait with attachment support, message threading, and user authentication:

Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Telegram, Microsoft Teams, Google Chat, Signal, Matrix, and iMessage (macOS only).

## Web vs Desktop

The Beacon app is a thin client. All AI processing, browser automation, and tool execution run on the gateway. Both web and Tauri desktop connect to the same gateway instance.

| Capability | Web | Desktop (Tauri) |
|---|---|---|
| Voice | Web Audio API | Native via IPC |
| Chat | WebSocket | Tauri event listeners |
| Gateway discovery | Localhost / manual | mDNS auto-discovery |
| Conversation storage | IndexedDB | IPC + local |

## Mobile

The gateway requires desktop hardware (audio capture via `cpal`). Mobile devices connect as thin clients to a running gateway:

1. **Now**: Open the web app in a mobile browser, point at your gateway
2. **Soon**: Tauri mobile builds (scaffolding exists for Android/iOS)
3. **Later**: Cloud-hosted gateway at `beacon.omni.dev`

## Getting Started

Detailed setup guides and API documentation coming soon. See [Orin](/orin) to learn about the flagship persona that runs on Beacon.
