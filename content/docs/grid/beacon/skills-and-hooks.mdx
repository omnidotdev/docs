title: Skills & Hooks
description: Extend your assistant with skills, auto-reply rules, and event hooks
---

Extend what your assistant can do. Skills teach it new capabilities, while hooks let you set up automatic responses and custom logic.

Beacon provides two extensibility systems: **skills** for adding capabilities to your assistant, and **hooks** for reacting to events with custom logic.

## Skills

Skills are markdown-based capability definitions that extend what your assistant can do. Each skill is a directory containing a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter.

### Skill Structure

```
~/.beacon/skills/
└── my-skill/
    └── SKILL.md
```

```markdown

### Skill Sources

Skills can be loaded from multiple sources:

| Source | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Local | Directories on the gateway filesystem |
| Manifold | Installed from the Omni persona marketplace |
| Bundled | Built into the gateway binary |

### Skill Registry

The gateway maintains a skill registry in SQLite, tracking installed skills with their metadata, version, author, tags, permissions, and enabled status.

### API

Skills are accessible through the gateway API:

- `GET /api/skills` — List installed skills
- `POST /api/skills` — Install a skill
- `DELETE /api/skills/{id}` — Remove a skill

## Hooks

Hooks let you run custom logic in response to gateway events. There are two types: built-in auto-reply rules and external hook scripts.

### Auto-Reply Rules

Define pattern-based auto-replies in your gateway config:

```toml
[[hooks.auto_reply]]
pattern = "^(hello|hi|hey)$"
reply = "Hey there! How can I help?"
case_insensitive = true
skip_agent = true

[[hooks.auto_reply]]
pattern = "office hours"
reply = "Office hours are Monday–Friday, 9am–5pm"
channels = ["discord", "slack"]
```

**Fields:**

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `pattern` | Regex pattern to match incoming messages |
| `reply` | Response text |
| `channels` | Optional channel filter |
| `skip_agent` | Skip LLM processing if matched |
| `case_insensitive` | Case-insensitive matching |

### External Hooks

Place executable hooks in `~/.beacon/hooks/`. Each hook is a directory containing a `HOOK.toml` manifest and an executable script:

```
~/.beacon/hooks/
└── my-hook/
    ├── HOOK.toml
    └── handler.sh
```

### Hook Events

| Event | Trigger |
|-------|---------|
| `message:received` | Incoming message from any channel |
| `message:before_agent` | Before sending a message to the LLM |
| `message:after_agent` | After receiving a response from the LLM |

### Hook Results

Hook scripts can return JSON to control processing:

```json
{
  "reply": "Custom response",
  "skip_agent": true,
  "skip_processing": false
}
```

- **reply** — Send a custom response instead of (or before) the LLM
- **skip_agent** — Skip LLM processing for this message
- **skip_processing** — Stop executing further hooks

### Configuration

```bash
# Enable/disable hooks
BEACON_HOOKS_ENABLED=true
```

The hooks directory path is configurable via the gateway config file (`hooks.path`).

## Tools

The gateway also includes built-in tools that the assistant can use during conversations:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Web Search | Search the web for current information |
| Web Fetch | Fetch and extract content from URLs |
| Browser | Automated browser interaction via CDP |
| Scheduling | Create and manage scheduled tasks (Vortex) |
| Session Tools | Access conversation history and context |

Tools are governed by a **tool policy** system that controls which tools are available per persona and context.
