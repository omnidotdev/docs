## Memory Sync

Sync your memories and preferences across all your devices.

**How it works:**
1. Memories are stored locally on your gateway
2. With cloud sync enabled, memories are encrypted and synced to Omni
3. Other gateways you own can pull synced memories
4. End-to-end encryption ensures only you can read your memories

**Enable:**
```toml
[cloud]
memory_sync = true
```

<Callout type="info">
  Memory sync requires an Omni account. Your memories are encrypted before leaving your device.
</Callout>

## Persona Marketplace

Browse and install personas created by the community.

**Features:**
- Discover new personas with different personalities and capabilities
- One-click installation to your gateway
- Rate and review personas
- Share your own personas

**Access:**
Navigate to the Persona Marketplace in the Beacon app, or visit [personas.omni.dev](https://personas.omni.dev).

## Omni Credits

Use Omni-hosted AI models with pay-per-use credits instead of bringing your own API keys.

**Benefits:**
- No API key management
- Automatic model selection
- Usage tracking and budgets
- Access to premium models

**Configure:**
```toml
[cloud]
use_omni_credits = true
# Optional: set a monthly budget
monthly_budget = 20.00
```

**BYOK (Bring Your Own Key):**
If you prefer to use your own API keys, Beacon works without Omni Credits:

```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key
```

## Remote Access

Access your gateway from anywhere via Omni relay.

**How it works:**
1. Your gateway establishes an outbound connection to Omni relay
2. Remote clients connect to Omni relay
3. Relay forwards traffic to your gateway
4. Your gateway never exposes ports to the internet

```
┌─────────────┐     outbound     ┌─────────────┐
│   Gateway   │─────────────────>│  Omni Relay │
│   (home)    │                  │   (cloud)   │
└─────────────┘                  └──────┬──────┘
                                        │
                                        ▼
                                 ┌─────────────┐
                                 │   Mobile    │
                                 │   (remote)  │
                                 └─────────────┘
```

**Enable:**
```toml
[cloud]
remote_access = true
```

**Security:**
- All traffic is encrypted end-to-end
- Device authentication still required
- Gateway never accepts inbound connections
- You control which devices can connect remotely

## Connecting Your Account

### First Time Setup

1. In the Beacon app, go to Settings → Cloud
2. Click "Connect Omni Account"
3. Sign in with your Omni account (or create one)
4. Authorize Beacon to access your account

# Opens browser for OAuth flow
```

### Disconnecting

## Privacy

Beacon is designed with privacy in mind:

- **Local by default**: Everything works without cloud
- **Opt-in sync**: You choose what to sync
- **Encrypted data**: Cloud-synced data is encrypted
- **No tracking**: We don't track your conversations
- **Data export**: Export all your cloud data anytime
- **Delete anytime**: Remove all cloud data with one click

## Data Residency

Cloud data is stored in:
- **US**: Default for most users
- **EU**: Available for EU users (GDPR compliant)

Configure in your Omni account settings.

## API Keys vs Omni Credits

**Bring Your Own Keys (BYOK):**

- Direct billing from providers
- Works offline
- No Omni account needed
- Supports multiple providers simultaneously

**Omni Credits:**
- No API key management
- Single bill for all models

- Automatic failover between models

You can use both: BYOK as primary with Omni Credits as fallback.

## Supported Providers (BYOK)

Beacon supports multiple AI providers for LLM, voice, and transcription:

| Provider | Services | Environment Variable |
|----------|----------|---------------------|
| OpenAI | LLM, TTS, STT (Whisper) | `OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| Anthropic | LLM (Claude) | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| OpenRouter | LLM (multi-model) | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` |
| ElevenLabs | TTS | `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` |
| Deepgram | STT | `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` |

Requests are automatically routed to the correct provider based on the model name.
