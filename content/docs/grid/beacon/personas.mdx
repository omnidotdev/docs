description: Customize your AI assistant's personality and voice
---

Personas define how your AI assistant sounds, behaves, and responds. Each persona has its own name, wake word, voice, and personality — so switching personas changes the entire experience.

## What Is a Persona?

A persona is a configuration file ([persona.json](/codex/persona-json)) that tells Beacon:

- **Who** the assistant is (name, tagline, icon)
- **How** it sounds (wake words, TTS voice, STT provider)
- **What** its personality is like (system prompt, tone, traits)

## Meet Orin

[Orin](/orin) is Beacon's default persona — a friendly otter guide. Orin comes pre-installed with every gateway.

```json
{
  "identity": {
    "id": "orin",
    "name": "Orin",
    "tagline": "Your friendly otter guide",
    "icon": "🦦",
    "type": "assistant"
  },
  "voice": {
    "wakeWords": ["hey orin", "hi orin", "okay orin"],
    "tts": { "provider": "openai", "voice": "nova", "speed": 1.0 },
    "stt": { "provider": "openai", "model": "whisper-1" }
  },
  "personality": {
    "systemPrompt": "You are Orin, a friendly and helpful AI assistant...",
    "tone": "friendly",
    "verbosity": "minimal",
    "traits": ["helpful", "curious", "playful", "knowledgeable"]
  }
}
```

## Customizing Your Persona

### Change the wake word

Edit the `voice.wakeWords` array in your persona's `persona.json`:

```json
{
  "voice": {
    "wakeWords": ["hey jarvis", "yo jarvis"]
  }
}
```

### Change the voice

Pick a different TTS voice or provider:

```json
{
  "voice": {
    "tts": { "provider": "elevenlabs", "voice": "rachel" }
  }
}
```

### Change the personality

Adjust the system prompt, tone, and traits:

```json
{
  "personality": {
    "systemPrompt": "You are a concise, technical assistant...",
    "tone": "professional",
    "verbosity": "concise",
    "traits": ["precise", "efficient"]
  }
}
```

## Creating a New Persona

1. Create a new directory in your personas folder (`~/.beacon/personas/my-persona/`)
2. Add a `persona.json` file following the [persona.json spec](/codex/persona-json)
3. Restart the gateway or reload personas from **Settings → Personas**

Your new persona appears in the persona switcher in the app.

## Installing from Manifold

Browse and install community-created personas from [Manifold](https://manifold.omni.dev):

1. Open **Settings → Personas → Browse Marketplace**
2. Find a persona you like
3. Click **Install**
4. The persona is downloaded to your gateway and ready to use

  Manifold access requires an Omni account. See [Cloud Features](/grid/beacon/cloud-features) for setup.

## Persona Storage

Personas are loaded from these sources, in order of priority:

| Source | Location |
|--------|----------|
| Local | `~/.beacon/personas/` (or custom `BEACON_PERSONAS_DIR`) |
| Manifold | Installed from the persona marketplace |
| Bundled | Built into the gateway binary (Orin) |

## Advanced

For the full persona configuration spec, including all available fields and options, see the [persona.json documentation](/codex/persona-json).
