Get up and running with Beacon in a few minutes.

## Download the Desktop App

Beacon is available as a desktop app for macOS, Linux, and Windows. The app bundles the gateway as a sidecar process, so there's nothing else to install.

Download the latest release from [beacon.omni.dev](https://beacon.omni.dev).

<Callout type="info">
  Want to run the gateway on a server or Raspberry Pi instead? See the [standalone gateway](#standalone-gateway) section below.
</Callout>

## First Launch

When you open Beacon for the first time:

1. The gateway starts automatically in the background
2. Your device generates a unique cryptographic identity (no account needed)
3. You land on the chat screen, ready to go

## Set Up Your AI Provider

Beacon routes all AI traffic through [Synapse](/grid/synapse), which manages provider keys and model routing. You have two options:

### Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)

Configure API keys in your Synapse config. Synapse dispatches requests to the appropriate provider:

| Provider | What It Powers |
|----------|---------------|
| Anthropic | Chat (Claude) |
| OpenAI | Chat (GPT), voice transcription (Whisper), speech (TTS) |
| Deepgram | Voice transcription (STT) |
| ElevenLabs | Speech (TTS) |

See the [Synapse docs](/grid/synapse) for provider configuration.

### Omni Credits

Don't want to manage API keys? Connect your Omni account and use pay-per-use credits instead. Go to **Settings → Cloud → Connect Omni Account**. See [Cloud Features](/grid/beacon/cloud-features) for details.

## Pair Additional Devices

Add your phone, tablet, or another computer to your gateway:

1. On your gateway device, go to **Settings → Devices → Generate Pairing Code**
2. A 6-digit code appears (valid for 10 minutes)
3. On the new device, open Beacon and enter the code
4. The device is now paired and can chat with your assistant

You can manage paired devices and revoke access anytime from **Settings → Devices**. See [Device Identity](/grid/beacon/device-identity) for technical details.

## Try Your First Chat

Type a message in the chat box and press enter. Your assistant responds using whichever AI provider you configured.

## Try Voice

1. Make sure Synapse has an STT and TTS provider configured (e.g. OpenAI for both Whisper and TTS)
2. Say your persona's wake word — the default is **"Hey Orin"**
3. Ask a question
4. Beacon transcribes your speech, sends it to the AI, and speaks the response back

See the [Voice guide](/grid/beacon/voice) for more on wake words, provider options, and troubleshooting.

## Standalone Gateway

If you'd rather run the gateway on a server or Raspberry Pi without the desktop app:

```bash
# Install
cargo install beacon-gateway

# Run with default persona
beacon-gateway --foreground --persona orin

# Run with verbose logging
beacon-gateway --foreground --verbose --persona orin
```

Then point a Beacon app (desktop, mobile, or web) at your gateway. The app will discover it automatically via [mDNS](/grid/beacon/discovery), or you can enter the gateway's IP address manually.

## Next Steps

- [Personas](/grid/beacon/personas) — Customize your assistant's personality
- [Channels](/grid/beacon/channels) — Connect Discord, Slack, Telegram, and more
- [Cloud Features](/grid/beacon/cloud-features) — Memory sync, remote access, and Omni Credits
