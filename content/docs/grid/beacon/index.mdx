**Omni Beacon** is a local-first voice and messaging gateway built in Rust. It runs on your machine or home server, keeping all your data local while providing seamless multi-device access through device-based identity and mDNS discovery.

## Local-First Principles

Beacon is designed around local-first principles:

- **Gateway is the source of truth**: All data lives on your gateway
- **No cloud account required**: Works completely offline
- **Device identity, not user accounts**: Ed25519 keypairs per device
- **mDNS auto-discovery**: Apps find your gateway automatically on LAN
- **Optional cloud sync**: Connect to Omni for cross-device memory sync

## Chat

Talk to your AI assistant through a familiar chat interface. Beacon keeps your conversation history locally on your gateway, with support for sessions, threading, and long-term memory. Configure your providers in [Synapse](/grid/synapse) or use [Omni Credits](/grid/beacon/cloud-features) for a zero-config experience.

## Voice

Beacon supports hands-free interaction with wake word detection, speech-to-text, and text-to-speech. Say your persona's wake word, ask a question, and hear the answer spoken back. See the [Voice guide](/grid/beacon/voice) for setup details.

| Component | Local | Cloud (via [Synapse](/grid/synapse)) |
|-----------|-------|--------------------------------------|
| Wake word detection | Yes | - |
| Speech-to-text | - | Whisper, Deepgram |
| Text-to-speech | - | OpenAI TTS, ElevenLabs |

## Personas

Beacon uses configurable [personas](/grid/beacon/personas) to shape how your assistant sounds and behaves. The default persona is [Orin](/orin), a friendly otter guide, but you can create your own or install community personas from [Manifold](https://manifold.omni.dev). Each persona has its own wake word, voice, and personality. See the [persona.json spec](/codex/persona-json) for advanced customization.

## Channels

Connect Beacon to your favorite messaging platforms. Your assistant works consistently across Discord, Slack, Telegram, Teams, Signal, and more. See [Channels](/grid/beacon/channels) for the full list and setup instructions.

## Getting Started

1. **Download**: Get the Beacon desktop app — the gateway runs automatically as a sidecar
2. **Set up AI**: Configure providers in [Synapse](/grid/synapse) or connect Omni Credits
3. **Pair devices**: Use a 6-digit pairing code to add phones, tablets, or other computers
4. **Customize**: Pick a persona, set your wake word, and configure voice
5. **Start talking**: Say your wake word and go

See the [Getting Started guide](/grid/beacon/getting-started) for a detailed walkthrough.
