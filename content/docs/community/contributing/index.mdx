We invite you to become an active participant in our open-source community at Omni. Your contributions play a pivotal role in the growth and success of our projects. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, there are many ways to get involved and make a difference.

This section outlines guidelines to help you get started. Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Omni ecosystem!

## Contribution Workflow

### Issues & Discussions

Before starting work, check for existing issues or discussions related to your idea. If none exist, open an issue to discuss your proposal. For questions or general discussion, join our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/omnidotdev).

### Branching

Create a feature branch from the default branch:

```bash
git switch -c feature/your-feature-name
```

Use descriptive branch names with prefixes like `feature/`, `fix/`, or `chore/`.

### Commits

Omni uses Extended Conventional Commits (ECC), our extension of [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org) with full-word type aliases for readability.

```
type(scope): description

feature(auth): add OAuth2 support
fix(api): handle null response
documentation(readme): update install steps
```

Write **atomic commits**: each commit should represent a single logical change.

### Pull Requests

Submit **atomic PRs**: each pull request should focus on a single change or feature.

- Keep pull requests focused and reviewable
- Update documentation to reflect your changes
- Add tests for new features
- Follow our [👑 Golden](/community/contributing/golden) guidelines

### Code Review

All contributions go through code review. Reviewers will check for:

- Adherence to [👑 Golden](/community/contributing/golden)
- Alignment with [quality pillars](/community/contributing/pillars)
- Test coverage and documentation
