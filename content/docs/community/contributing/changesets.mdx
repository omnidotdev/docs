# 🦋 Changesets

Changesets ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/changeset)) represent an _intent_ to evolve a project in the form of a collection of changes. We use a tool with the same name, [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets), to manage them and handle the versioning, changelog generation, and release lifecycle.

#### Creation

<Callout>
  As a general rule of thumb, changesets should only be created for user-facing
  API changes, such as updates to a component's functionality or visual style.
  Changes to a testing suite, for example, should not be accompanied by a
  changeset.
</Callout>

1. To create a changeset, run `bun changeset` in the project directory.

2. You will be prompted to select a bump type based on the [SemVer](https://semver.org/) spec.

3. Write a message describing the change, using present tense and starting with a verb. For example, if you are adding a new component called `Card`, you might write:

```
Add `Card` component
```

If you're fixing a bug for the Card component, you might write:

```
Fix `Card` resizing after initial page load
```

After the changeset is created, it will be added to the `.changeset` folder at the root of the project repository, where it can be safely modified and committed. There is no limit to the number of changesets you can create, even in one PR.
