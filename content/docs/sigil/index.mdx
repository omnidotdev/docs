## What’s Included

Sigil provides:

- **Design tokens** for color, spacing, typography, and other visual primitives.
- **Prebuilt components** like buttons, inputs, and dialogs, designed with accessibility and responsiveness in mind.
- **Theming support** to customize appearance while maintaining consistency.
- **Developer-first ergonomics** to be fast, composable, and type-safe.

## Core Goals

- **CSS and framework agnosticism**: Sigil is built on [Panda CSS](https://panda-css.com/), a CSS-in-JS engine that compiles to static, atomic CSS. This makes it easy to decouple styling from specific frontend frameworks, enabling adoption across diverse environments.
- **Customizable by anyone**: Even outside the Omni ecosystem, teams can extend or override the Sigil theme to suit their brand or product needs. Panda CSS makes theme extension intuitive and scalable.
- **Modern design system best practices**: Sigil is built to serve as a foundation for scalable design and development collaboration, following accessibility standards and flexible architecture principles.
