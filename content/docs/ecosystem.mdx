Omni creates software that empowers individuals, businesses, and developers. Most of our projects are open source, reflecting our commitment to transparency, collaboration, and innovation.

## What We Build

Our ecosystem includes a diverse range of software, from developer tools and APIs to full-fledged applications. Whether you're looking for authentication solutions, performance-driven backend services, or intuitive UI components, Omni has something for you.

### We ❤️ Open Source

We believe in the power of open source. By making our software freely available, we encourage community-driven development, allowing developers to contribute, customize, and extend our projects to suit their needs. For our open-source reasoning, see [Why Open Source?](/open-source)

## Explore the Omni Ecosystem

A visual map of our software ecosystem (the "Omniverse") can be seen below and at https://verse.omni.dev, which is powered by a hierarchical ecosystem modeling specification we created called Garden (https://garden.omni.dev). You can also explore our repositories on https://github.com/omnidotdev, contribute to ongoing projects, or check out our documentation to see how everything connects! 🚀
