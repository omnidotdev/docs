**Omni life.json** is a portable, composable JSON specification for capturing your digital identity. Owned by the individual and consumed by any compatible platform, enabling true data portability and anti-vendor-lock-in.

## Design Philosophy

life.json separates **actual data** (small, truly portable) from **references** (pointers to where data lives). Your identity file stays lightweight while connecting to everything:

- **Actual data** — Identity, preferences, and assistant context travel with you
- **References** — Accounts, calendars, and knowledge bases are linked, not duplicated
- **Export URLs** — Every external integration includes an export path for data portability

## Schema Slices

life.json uses a modular slice architecture. All slices are optional—include only what you need:

### Actual Data (portable)

| Slice | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `identity` | Name, pronouns, timezone, locale, location, occupation, bio |
| `preferences` | Language, theme, communication style, accessibility, privacy, units |
| `assistants` | Per-assistant learned facts, preferences, context, permissions, and stats |

### References (pointers to external data)

| Slice | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `accounts` | Connected platform accounts with export URLs |
| `social` | Social profiles, primary link-in-bio, curated links |
| `relationships` | Key people, contact methods, groups |
| `calendar` | Calendar references, working hours, scheduling preferences |
| `memories` | Photo/video source references, highlights, important dates |
| `knowledge` | Knowledge base/vault references and topics |
| `finances` | Account references (never balances), currency, budget categories |

## The Assistants Bridge

The `assistants` slice is the bridge between life.json and [persona.json](/codex/persona-json). While persona.json defines *what a persona is*, life.json stores *your relationship with it*:

```
persona.json (developer-owned)         life.json (user-owned)
  ├─ identity                            ├─ identity
  ├─ voice                               ├─ preferences
  ├─ personality       ──────────>       ├─ assistants["orin"]
  ├─ branding                            │   ├─ learnedFacts
  └─ capabilities                        │   ├─ preferences
                                         │   ├─ context
                                         │   └─ permissions
```

Each assistant entry includes:

- **Learned facts** — What the assistant knows about you, with confidence scores and source tracking (`explicit`, `inferred`, `corrected`)
- **Per-assistant preferences** — Your verbosity, tone, and topic preferences for this assistant
- **Context** — Current projects, goals, and notes
- **Permissions** — What you allow this assistant to do (learn, access calendar, execute code, etc.)
- **Stats** — Conversation count and interaction timestamps

## Product Integration

| Product | Reads | Writes |
|---------|-------|--------|
| [Gatekeeper](/armory/hidra/gatekeeper) | identity, preferences, assistants | identity, preferences, assistants (host) |
| [Beacon](/grid/beacon) | identity, preferences, calendar | assistants |
| [Blink](/kindred/blink) | identity, social | social |
| [Moment](/kindred/moment) | relationships | memories, relationships |
| [Trellis](/fabric/trellis) | — | knowledge |
| [MyFi](/core/myfi) | — | finances |
| [Forever](/codex/forever) | identity, accounts, relationships | — |

## Examples

### Minimal

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://life.omni.dev/life.schema.json",
    "identity": {
    "name": "Brian",
    "timezone": "America/Los_Angeles"
  }
}
```

### With Assistant

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://life.omni.dev/life.schema.json",
    "identity": {
    "name": "Brian",
    "timezone": "America/Los_Angeles",
    "locale": "en-US",
    "occupation": "Software Engineer"
  },
  "preferences": {
    "language": "en",
    "theme": "dark",
    "communication": { "style": "concise" },
    "units": { "temperature": "fahrenheit", "timeFormat": "12h" }
  },
  "assistants": {
    "orin": {
      "enabled": true,
      "learnedFacts": [
        {
          "fact": "Prefers Rust over Go for systems programming",
          "confidence": 0.9,
          "source": "explicit",
          "learnedAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
        }
      ],
      "preferences": {
        "verbosity": "minimal",
        "tone": "friendly",
        "expertise": ["rust", "typescript", "distributed-systems"]
      },
      "context": {
        "currentProjects": ["beacon gateway", "persona marketplace"],
        "goals": ["ship voice MVP", "launch persona.json spec"]
      },
      "permissions": {
        "canLearn": true,
        "canAccessCalendar": true,
        "canBrowseWeb": true,
        "canExecuteCode": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## File Discovery

Beacon looks for life.json in this order:

1. `LIFE_JSON_PATH` environment variable
2. `~/.life.json`
3. `~/.config/life.json`

## Getting Started

1. Create a JSON file with `$schema` pointing to `https://life.omni.dev/life.schema.json`
2. Add an `identity` slice with at least your `name`
3. Add optional slices as needed — start with `preferences` and `assistants`
4. Place it at `~/.life.json` or set `LIFE_JSON_PATH`
5. Validate against the schema — see the [repository](https://github.com/omnidotdev/life-json) for more examples
